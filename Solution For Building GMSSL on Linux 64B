Quick Start
 -----------

 If you want to just get on with it, do:

  on Unix/Linux (again, this includes Mac OS/X):

    $ ./config
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

If any of these steps fails, see section Installation in Detail below.

 This will build and install OpenSSL in the default location, which is:

  Unix/Linux:    normal installation directories under /usr/local

If you want to install it anywhere else, run config like this:

  On Unix:

    $ ./config --prefix=/opt/openssl --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl

(Note: if you do add options to the configuration command, please make sure
 you've read more than just this Quick Start, such as relevant NOTES.* files,
 the options outline below, as configuration options may change the outcome
 in otherwise unexpected ways)

Configuration Options
 ---------------------

 There are several options to ./config (or ./Configure) to customize
 the build :

  --openssldir=DIR
                   Directory for OpenSSL configuration files, and also the
                   default certificate and key store.  Defaults are:

                   Unix:           /usr/local/ssl

  --prefix=DIR
                   The top of the installation directory tree.  Defaults are:

                   Unix:           /usr/local
